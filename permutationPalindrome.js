// InterviewCake #30 - Permutation Palindrome
// Write an efficient function that checks whether any permutation of an input string is a palindrome.
//
// Examples:
// "civic" should return true
// "ivicc" should return true
// "civil" should return false
// "livci" should return false
//
// "But 'ivicc' isn't a palindrome!"
// If you had this thought, read the question again carefully. We're asking if any permutation of the string is a palindrome. Spend some extra time ensuring you fully understand the question before starting. Jumping in with a flawed understanding of the problem doesn't look good in an interview.
